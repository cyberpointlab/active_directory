# 01. Installing Domain Controller

1. Use ```sconfig``` to:
    - change the hostname
    - change the IP address to static
    - change the DNS to our own IP addr

2. Install Active Directive Windows Feature

```
    Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools
    Import-Module ADDSDeployment
    Install-ADDSForest
```
    - setup DNS again because it is reverted to 127.0.0.1
